The more oxygen, the lower the octopus's respiratory rate and lower its oxygen saturation at sea temperatures, as well as having many other factors associated with the higher death rate of the animal.\n","\n","An octopus doesn't have a heart-healing system or respiratory system like some people think, so most scientists are assuming that the heart is still working.
